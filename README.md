Midterm_Mashup
==============

This is a project using the public API's from both Spotify and Facebook.  We are taking a Facebook user's 'likes' (under user_music) and creating a private playlist in their Spotify account.

If time allows I would like to:
* add the functionality to let the user name the plalist as well as change the visibility.
* add a text input to give the user the ability to set the number of songs to pull. (dividing equally among the artists)
